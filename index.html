    <h1>Our Diary</h1>

    <p class="soft">
      I’m not here to convince you or pull you anywhere.  
      I just wanted you to hear *me* — quietly, without noise.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
      Texts feel rushed sometimes.  
      Conversations get mixed with too many opinions.  
      This is just me, slowing things down, once.
    </p>

    <p>
      There’s something I’ve always felt about us.  
      Even when we step away, we somehow find our way back.  
      Not out of habit — but out of comfort, familiarity, and something that still feels real.
    </p>

    <!-- PHOTOS -->
    <div class="photo-grid">
      <img src="./photo1.jpg" alt="">
      <img src="./photo2.jpg" alt="">
      <img src="./photo3.jpg" alt="">
      <img src="./photo4.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
      I just want you to see what’s right in front of you —  
      two people who cared deeply,  
      who couldn’t let go easily,  
      and one person here who has finally understood a lot of things.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m not saying we were perfect.  
      We weren’t.  
      But I see my mistakes clearly now —  
      and I genuinely want to fix what I once didn’t know how to handle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting go can feel lighter in the moment.  
      But some things deserve one honest pause,  
      one real look,  
      before being left behind.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <!-- SHIVJI STORY (FIGHTING THROUGH SELF-WORK, UNCHANGED) -->
    <p>
      I grew up hearing stories where love wasn’t rushed.  
      Where even Shiv didn’t chase or force anything —  
      he worked on himself, faced his fears, and became steady.
    </p>

    <p>
      That story stayed with me.  
      Love doesn’t return because you beg for it —  
      it returns when you become safe enough to hold it.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
      I understand why you’re scared.  
      Honestly, I would be too.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t expect trust immediately.  
      I don’t expect belief without time.
    </p>

    <p>
      I choose not to give up —  
      not by forcing anything,  
      but by learning, changing, and showing up better than before.
    </p>

    <p>
      All I ask is this —  
      just look into this once,  
      when you feel ready.  
      Nothing more than that.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
      Distance scared me once too.  
      Then I realised something.
    </p>

    <p>
      Achievements feel a little empty  
      when the person who believed in you  
      isn’t there to hear about them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Distance doesn’t weaken real things.  
      It only shows what already mattered.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
      And if you ever felt tired of swimming in thoughts,  
      you wouldn’t need to decide anything.  
      Just a place to sit, breathe,  
      and rest for a moment.
    </p>

    <p class="closing">
      I just wanted you to know where I stand —  
      calmly, honestly, without pulling you anywhere.
    </p>

    <div class="signature">
      i love you — siddu baby
